# Contributing to [REPOSITORY_NAME]

Welcome! We're excited to have you contribute to the [REPOSITORY_NAME] project. This guide will help you get started with cloning the repository and raising a new Pull Request (PR) for approval, which will eventually be merged into the main branch.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't have one already.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine.
3. Set up your Git [username](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-profile-settings/setting-your-username) and [email](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the [REPOSITORY_NAME](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME) repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page.


This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

Now, you need to clone the forked repository to your local machine. To do this:

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Code** button and copy the URL.



3. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
4. Run the following command to clone the repository, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with the appropriate values:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
Step 3: Create a New Branch
Navigate to your cloned repository:

sh
Copy code
cd REPOSITORY_NAME
Create a new branch for your changes. Replace BRANCH_NAME with a descriptive name for your branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
Step 4: Make Changes and Commit
Make changes to the code, following the project's coding style and conventions. Once you have made your changes, stage and commit them:

sh
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Replace Your commit message with a brief description of your changes.

Step 5: Push Your Changes
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

sh
Copy code
git push origin BRANCH_NAME
Replace BRANCH_NAME with the name of your branch.

Step 6: Create a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click the Pull Requests tab.
Click the New Pull Request button.
Choose main branch of the original repository as the base branch and your branch as the compare branch.
Review your changes and click Create Pull Request.
Fill in the PR template with a description of your changes, any related issues, and mention any reviewers.
Click Create Pull Request.
Create Pull Request

Wait for the project maintainers to review your PR. They may request changes or ask questions. Keep an eye on the PR for any notifications and respond as needed.

Once your PR is approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

Congratulations! You've successfully contributed to the [REPOSITORY_NAME] project.
